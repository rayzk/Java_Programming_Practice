### 1.1 The progress of abstraction

All programming language provides abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the problems you are able to solve is directly related to the kind and quality of **abstraction**

**Example of steps of abstraction**

* Machine language
* Assembly language
* Imperative language (*FORTRAN ,BASIC, C*)

**Approaches of problem solving**

* **Imperative language** still requires the association between ***structure of computer*** and ***structure of problem*** (*machine model* and *problem model*)
* **Constraint-based programming approach** requires to modeling the problem only. **LISP** and **APL** choose particular views of the world. (e.g. all problems are lists/decisions)
* **Object-oriented approach** build connections between elements in the problem space and representations in the solutions space as ***objects***

**Smalltalk**

> Smalltalk is the first successful object oriented language and one upon which java is based

> *An object has state, behavior and identity* -- Booch


### 1.2 An object has an interface

**Class**

* ***Abstract data types*** are fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, the same as build-in types
